# PetCare

PetCare is a monitoring system for pets (mainly dogs and cats) that allows you to check for the health status of your pet on your smartphone while you're not around.

This project consists of two parts. A mobile app in charge of displaying the data to the user, and an IoT collar device for the pet in charge of reading the variables that will be displayed on the app.
